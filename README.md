## 📌 Project Overview

This notebook presents a deep-dive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the widely used **Adult Income Dataset**.

🔍 Goals:
- Investigate income distribution trends
- Explore how demographics like age, education, and gender influence income
- Engineer new features such as `gain+loss` for total capital change

📈 Visuals include:
- Bar charts, violin plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps
- Clean, intuitive data storytelling with clear insights
